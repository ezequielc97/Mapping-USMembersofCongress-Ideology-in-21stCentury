### Introduction ###

DW-NOMINATE Scores are measures of legislators' ideological positions in a basic space developed by Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal. The proximity of two legislators in this space reflects the similarity of their voting records. The model assumes individual legislators have stable ideological positions over their congressional careers. As such, the distribution of the scores can be seen as a representation of polarization. The scores go along two dimensions. The primary dimension, which is the focus of this project, is the "left-right" dimension (sometimes called the "liberal-conservative" dimension). This single dimension correctly predicts the vast majority of legislators' votes cast in modern Congresses in the United States. 

The scores for each dimension range from -1 (more ideologically left) to 1 (more ideologicaly right). The measures can be used to gauge at polarization, but comprehension of these scores can not be complete without historical knowledge of the details of the issues that the votes revolved around.

The purpose of this work in progress is to map US Representatives' and Senators' ideological scores onto their districts.
This project will map by color DW-Nominate Scores for members of the United States Congress (both Representatives and Senators) by Congressional District for the period of 2000-2018. 

This project uses ideological data accessible through voteview.com. Voteview.com hosts DW-Nominate Score data for all Members of Congress from the 1st to 116th Congresses (see citation at end of doc).
