# Mapping-USMembersofCongress-Ideology-in-21stCentury #

#### Introduction ####

The purpose of this work in progress is to map US Representatives' and Senators' ideological scores onto their districts.

DW-NOMINATE Scores are a measure of ideology developed by Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal at Carnegie-Mellon University between in the late 1980's. 

This work in progress will map DW-Nominate Scores for US members of Congress (US Representatives and Senators) by Congressional District for the period of 2000-2018. This project uses ideological data accessible through voteview.com. Voteview.com hosts DW-Nominate Score data for all Members of Congress from the 1st to 116th Congresses (see citation at end of doc).
