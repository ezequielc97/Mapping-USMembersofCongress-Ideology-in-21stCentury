# Mapping-USMembersofCongress-Ideology-in-21stCentury

##### Introduction

The purpose of this work in progress is to create a geo-spatial
visualization of the ideological representation in the United States
Congress.

DW-NOMINATE Scores are a measure of ideology developed by Keith T. Poole
and Howard Rosenthal at Carnegie-Mellon University between in the late
1980’s.

This work in progress will map DW-Nominate Scores for US members of
Congress (US Representatives and Senators) by Congressional District for
the period of 2000-2018. This project uses ideological data accessible
through voteview.com. Voteview.com hosts DW-Nominate Score data for all
Members of Congress from the 1st to 116th Congresses (see citation at
end of doc).

##### File Table

  - “map-master.qgz” ….. master QGIS map project
  - "

##### To Do Next

  - Add 2016-2018 Congressional district layer to GIS proj
  - update file table
  - build script to plot individual district scores over years
  - build script to subset by political party, add party layer to GIS
    proj
